I have many csv files with medical data. 
Analize them and give me an overview.
Here is the first few lines of each file:

// Output from `head -n 5 *.csv` was here

...

I want to join them into one dataframe with each row representing one persons data using Python and Pandas.

...

This is the script after adapting it with all the files and adding the proper name to the biomarker column. But I'M getting duplicate age columns, I want to ignore those and only have one age column. They should all be the same for the same person since the analysis are from the same year. 

// Code here

Excellent, now they are merged in one big csv. 

I want another script that opens that csv and calculates:
- the correlation of each biomarker with age.
I want to plot the correlations. x should be marker, y should be correlation.

Here is the first few lines of the csv:

...

Now I want to use the same csv and calculate the PCA and plot them as a 2d scatter plot. 

...

Lets use the elbow method to identify how many components we want to use. 

...

pca is cool, but umap is better, lets do umap into 2d and plot.

...

I like how you colored the dots with the age, lets do the same for the pca. Also lets try to explain which are the main contributors to each component.

// Code was here

... 

drop correlations whose absolute value is below 0.5 

// Code was here

...

Can we also calculate the significance of each correlation? And keep only the significant ones? 

...

Neat, now that we have the relevant biomarkers correlated to aging, lets do a heatmap of the correlation between them (only the significant ones) and plot that. Give me the python code.

Base it on this code:
// Code was here

...

alright, now i want to rotate the x labels a bit, like 45 degree, so they all fit. 

...

any way to calculate non-linear correlation ?

...

Which are consider better? Which would make more sense when correlating it with aging? What about when correlating biomarkers among themselves to identify the most relevant ones for disambiguation? 

...

Can I calculate the significance of the correlations for Spearman Rank and Mutual Information? How? 

...

How about calculating the correlation matrix using spearman? 

Adapt current code:
// Code was here

...

how can i filter the corr_matrix to keep only those whose abs correlation is > 0.9?

...

Now I want to go back, and cluster columns by similarity, to find related biomarkers, say cluster all the kidney health related, and such. What method do you propose? 

...

Give me a python script that will open a csv with this shape and plot the clusters. Use umap for dimensionality reduction and dbscan for clustering. Consider how we will need to modify the data since i want to cluster the columns, not the rows.

...

Now I have the clusters and I've saved them along with the original data to a csv.

I want to identify why those clusters are different from the main cluster, or what makes them different among themselves, how could I do that? Just taking the mean for each biomarker seems a bit basic, what methods are there to explain the clustering? 

...

I prefer some of the statistical tests. Give me python code that opens the csv and explains the clusters. there is a "cluster" column in the csv.

...

Give me python code that gets the 2 more significant columns and plot them against each other on a scatter plot x and y the color being the cluster.

...

I'm using the standard scaler to normalize the data, but there are some outliers, I'l like to clip it or to take some logarithmic approach so that the outliers don't skew the mean so much. What other scaler options are there and which are appropriate for this case?

...

is there a way to measure how skewed a distribution is? 

...

Excellent, we've further reduced the number of useful biomarkers, and kept only those correlated to age with a close to Gaussian distribution, normalized to avoid distortion by outliers. Now I want to create a model that will take the biomarkers as input and generate the age as output. I want it to be explainable so we van gather insight from the model, but it should also learn all kind of relationships from the data, not just linear. 

...

Lets add to the end of it code to display a scatter plot showing the relationship between y and y_pred. Train data should be colored red, test data should be colored green.

...

Can we make it so that the shap explainer shows the feature name / biomarker name instead of just Feature 1, etc. ? 

...

We got this result. Mean Absolute Error: 8.800030678409641
